## Mixed Models
- Sommer
- Regress
- rrBLUP
- nlme
- lme4

## Bayesian Analysis
- BGLR: Bayesian Generalized Linear Regression (whole-genome prediction)
- MCMCglmm: Bayesian Generalized Linear Regression (broader applications)
- JAGS: Bayesian programming language.
- brsm: An R Package for Bayesian Multilevel Models using Stan

## GWAS
- GEMMA: univariate, multivariate and Bayesian Variable Selection methods
