- Thursday periods 8 and 9 (3:00-4:55), FIF 2316

### Pre-requisites

- AGR5321 – Genetic Improvement of Plants or equivalent plant breeding course 
- STA616 or equivalent.

### Description

This course focuses on practical application of plant breeding, genetics, and statistics to devise effective approaches to meet particular breeding goals. Highlighting real life situations and key decisions that plant breeders face, the course builds upon knowledge of plant breeding methods and quantitative genetic theory. Four specific functional areas, which somewhat reflect divisions of labor in breeding programs and seed industry, are addressed: population development, population evaluation, trait integration, and product commercialization and supply. 

### Intended Audience
The course is designed for MS and PhD graduate students in the following disciplines: plant breeding, agronomy, horticultural sciences, plant genetics and molecular genetics.

### Course Objectives
To familiarize students with advanced breeding strategies, methods, and techniques in plant breeding, and how to apply those concepts in breeding programs. At the end of the course, students should be able to describe and discuss population genetic parameters, mating designs, differentiate between mating designs for additive and dominance variation,  and genomic selection.
