Hello. My name is Luis Felipe Ventorim Ferrão and I'm a postdoctoral associate at the University of Florida, working under [Patricio Munoz](https://www.blueberrybreeding.com/) in the Blueberry Breeding Program. I obtained my Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Breeding at the University of São Paulo (ESALQ,USP), Brazil. I am currently interested in statistical genetics, mixed models, Bayesian approaches and quantitative genetics of polyploids.
