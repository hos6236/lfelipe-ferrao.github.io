Hello.

My name is Luis Felipe Ventorim Ferrão and I'm a postdoctoral associate at the University of Florida, working under Patricio Munoz  supervision in the [Blueberry Breeding and Genomics Lab](https://www.blueberrybreeding.com/). 

I obtained my Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Breeding at the University of São Paulo (ESALQ,USP), Brazil. I am currently interested in statistical genetics, mixed models, Bayesian approaches and quantitative genetics of polyploids. You can read more about my work on this webpage and also see codes, papers and talks associated with my research.
