# Description

Hello. My name is Felipe and I'm a postdoctoral associate at the University of Florida, working under [Patricio Munoz](https://www.blueberrybreeding.com/). I obtained my Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Breeding at the University of São Paulo (ESALQ,USP), Brazil. I am currently interested in computing for statistical Genetics, mixed models, Bayesian approaches and quantitative genetics of polyploids.
