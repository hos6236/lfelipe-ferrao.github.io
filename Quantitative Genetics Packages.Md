Below, I listed some R packages and software that I have been using for quantitative genetics analysis during my academic works:

## Mixed Models
- [Sommer](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sommer/vignettes/sommer.pdf)
- [Regress](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/regress/regress.pdf)
- rrBLUP
- nlme
- lme4

## Bayesian Analysis
- BGLR: Bayesian Generalized Linear Regression (whole-genome prediction)
- MCMCglmm: Bayesian Generalized Linear Regression (broader applications)
- JAGS: Bayesian programming language.
- brsm: An R Package for Bayesian Multilevel Models using Stan

## GWAS
- GEMMA: univariate, multivariate and Bayesian Variable Selection methods

## Polyploid analysis

- Updog: allele dosage using from NGS.
- GWASpoly: K+Q model under different gene action.
